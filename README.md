Esbern Snare official band website repository.

This is the first full website I've attempted to build in my coding journey so far.  In the end, I'm hoping it will serve as a functional website for my band on the release of our second album come fall of 2022.  Still a lot of work to be done on it polish-wise, but excited by the progress!  The goal I set for myself was to create a clean, single-page website sans scroll, allowing the modals to serve the role otherwise taken by pages, while keeping everything easily accessible and without much of a navigation requirement on the user's end.  This has also been my first experiment in familiarizing myself with Bootstrap and I feel like I've learned a lot!  Not much done on the JavaScript side of things, but I think the next project I work on will be more for that purpose, as I hadn't found much need here.  I am also uber-rookie on that side of development as it stands.  Comments or recommendations always welcome and appreciated!

Primary tools utilized: Bootstrap, CSS animations, Express.js
