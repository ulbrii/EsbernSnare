						<p>Watch for despair has followed you out, so fast upon your heels</p>
						<p>Your staggering work to grip the earth has left you struck to every nerve</p>
						<p>And you returned for whom the strangeness lurks and is a commonness</p>
						<p>Said, “come on down, the wind blows heavy now and you are overrun”</p>

						<p>The strength of a woman to walk this yard, when at the door you cant explain</p>
						<p>How something’s changed—the walls awake with shiftings of a wandering ghost</p>
						<p>And the billows rose in asking where you’ll go now, should it all remain?</p>
						<p>For what has begun, nothing’s won</p>
						<p>But you can learn to cope this way</p>
						<br />
						<p>And now your stretch yearns</p>
						<p>To find the breadth of relief</p>
						<p>That anyone can just leave and be gone</p>
						<p>A solemn mender</p>
						<p>The final hold of release, and when it’s gone I will need it again</p>
						<br />
						<p>I wish for dreams, the glow of lights at sea,</p>
						<p>I wish too many things</p>
						<p>But i will bring that coast what’s left of me</p>
						<p>And I will dream</p>

						<p>You bent to heave a clambering heart</p>
						<p>Rattled son, you have been harmed</p>
						<p>But you’re strong, your child’s strong, it is wrong but carry</p>
						<p>Through everything, your every part felt much more of hurt before any car the metals tore</p>
						<p>You were gone, you have been wronged</p>
						<br />
						<p>Careless the ropes that wore to bone</p>
						<p>Calloused my hands that never learned how to let go</p>
						<p>Careless to kill the stars, a son</p>
						<p>Calloused my will to never forgive what was done</p>
						<p>If i could start to heal for once</p>
						<p>Those labored eyes where all of my anger is lost</p>
						<p>While any fervency is mine</p>
						<p>I’ll make this right if I’m less alive when it’s done</p>
