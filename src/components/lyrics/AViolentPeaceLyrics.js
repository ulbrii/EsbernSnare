						<h3>1. The Great Drowner</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Friend, have you gone? Are you now displeased?</p>
						<p>Far underneath there were shadows with me</p>
						<p>Patch it up for my mind always bleeds</p>
						<p>the walls of frames and faces always in streams.</p>
						<br />
						<p>And you ran down the lawn to where I fell</p>
						<p>What hand undealt?</p>
						<p>Oh what grace that can be felt</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>Something so dear, somehow holds on so strong</p>
						<p>I spent so long drying out up here.</p>
						<p>I was never once for change, nor it for me and yet it came</p>
						<p>A thousand miles of wind and rain, and as I drowned the waters sang,</p>
						<p>"All hail, all hail, The Great Drowner of them all will fail.</p>
						<p>What man can tell? For the number of his days are veiled."</p>
						<br />
						<p>And the sleeping lake, said "I've never learned to wake.</p>
						<p>For my life you sank, what I've loved you have erased."</p>
						<p>Oh, life, you've changed.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Love, take me home</p>
						<p>Life so young</p>

						<h3>2. Anchorage</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Taken to the east when I was young.</p>
						<p>Carved by the mountains, we filled our lungs.</p>
						<p>But it's hard to breathe deeply when it's all so close</p>
						<p>and it's all that you've known.</p>
						<br />
						<p>You've lost all control, now lets see where you go.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Tell me, ocean, where do I come from?</p>
						<p>Cuz your other side has kept me for so long.</p>
						<p>And it's hard to be far from the places you've grown</p>
						<p>but this place it was home.</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>You've lost all control, to the sails of your boat.</p>
						<p>I know it's not mine, but I'm reaching for time.</p>
						<p>This sea's always changing, lets anchor our aging.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Oh, God, it's too soon, when I settle you move.</p>
						<p>I'm scared with each year, I'll forget what was here.</p>
						<p>If homesickness hurts, then I'm aching like hell.</p>

						<h3>3. War When You Wake</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Child, how you strain</p>
						<p>and your words they don't sound the same.</p>
						<p>It's a silent cage, locked in silent ways.</p>
						<br />
						<p>With all your thoughts worn, what could be said plain</p>
						<p>of the world in your brain?</p>
						<p>For the world it is strange.</p>
						<br />
						<p>You're slipping out the door, but you'll crawl back when you fall poor.</p>
						<p>May your feet find a place for your mind</p>
						<p>a place for your kind.</p>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>Child, they're away with their old friend decay</p>
						<p>with a thief who is never late</p>
						<p>they don't know restraint.</p>
						<br />
						<p>And with your tears comes a war when you wake</p>
						<p>with a violent ache.</p>
						<p>for it's all you can take.</p>
						<br />
						<p>A cloth a branch has worn, but you'll hold on as you are torn.</p>
						<p>May the trees find, a place for your mind</p>
						<p>a place for your kind.</p>

						<h3>5. The Rains</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Oh the rains would erase my name</p>
						<p>oh, my Lord, have I gone too far?</p>
						<p>I've built an empire for myself, oh the wealth of need found in gain.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Day subsides, all our cares untied in their rooms and under their sheets.</p>
						<p>But when you rise, will you wear your pride with the blood of what you don't need?</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>Blind decay, how we choose to stay</p>
						<p>every sense so quickly misplaced.</p>
						<p>In shade of walls I have watched love hang, as the ropes will carry the blame.</p>
						<br />
						<p>So dig your holes for their swords and spears, but it's the minds of man that I fear.</p>
						<p>Slaves of none, what our wills have done will be seen when all come unclean.</p>

						<h3>6. Troglodyte</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>And the pain in your eyes is unspoken</p>
						<p>all the words put under the shade.</p>
						<p> Still a light you will be for another</p>
						<p>if you'd only learn how to wait.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Troglodyte, is that you in the open?</p>
						<p>Have you come to settle down?</p>
						<p>Still today there are words for tomorrow</p>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>How you've drifted away</p>
						<p>to a cold house enough, to bear your thoughts</p>
						<p>to hold your words, til the end of the day.</p>
						<p>A table for us, set so plain</p>
						<p>to relieve your weight</p>
						<p>then you go on your way.</p>
						<br />
						<p>And you stand in the fields with your Father</p>
						<p>and you ask how could this be real?</p>
						<p>There were days when it seemed you were nowhere...</p>
						<p>Have I lost all sense of feel?</p>
						<br />
						<p>Troglodyte, is that you in the open?</p>

						<h3>7. Inside Your Coat</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Swept aside, an ash of my own flame.</p>
						<p>I tried to run, oh I tried to hide.</p>
						<p>I cried, "Heal my eyes, for a fire burns that should have no fuel!"</p>
						<p>Oh, God, be here...</p>
						<br />
						<p>Hem me in, inside your coat my love</p>

						<p>The warmth in the night</p>
						<p>all the drives.</p>
						<p>These questions flooded my heart</p>
						<br />
						<p>Where is the one you keep for me?</p>
						<p>Will they see past my own sin?</p>

						<h3>8. You've Changed</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>We set out for lights of a thousand boats, sunk our lines</p>
						<p>far from sight, shores of houses hide, still waves shine.</p>
						<p>Fire floats, and bursts the night</p>
						<p>oh life, you've changed.</p>
						<br />
						<p>Some years before was a boy on these shores</p>
						<p>In a house among trees, in a violent peace</p>
						<p>And our youth has traced every wall in this place</p>
						<p>But I wake these days, and I'm fearful of age so soon</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>You've lost all control to the sails of your boat</p>
						<p>Now what will you choose as your anchors break loose?</p>
						<p>Oh, Father, I'll be but a wake in your breeze</p>
						<p>An ash in your coat, dug in gardens ungrown</p>
						<p>And I'll see you soon when we finally bloom</p>
						<p>Oh crux of my bones, oh incomparable home</p>
