						<h3>1. Joys of Kin</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>That train, the hounds, your core</p>
						<p>What bellows out trying to figure out what's before?</p>
						<p>With your head against the glass, do you ever tend to wander out and be gone?</p>
						<br />
						<p>Come now the joys of kin, as the warmest sound ever heard in your lasting years</p>
						<p>For in my family's glow, I will not be ashamed of us</p>
						<br />
						<p>I've not let go of us, they found a way to burn through the nerve 'til we've never had</p>
						<p>As they come to speak in tones like I have faced the facts, when anymore I,</p>
						<p>I still wonder how it will work itself out where we're fine</p>
						<p>And the headlights will turn through the snow in the blinds</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The light shoots through the marks, like a million stars splintered out in a flash and flurr
						</p>
						<p>To the specks of distant worlds</p>
						<p>Such a smallness, life existing now on the glass you watch</p>
					</Col>

						<p>I've not let go of us, they found a way to burn through the nerve 'til we've never had</p>
						<p>As they come to speak in tones like i have faced the facts, when anymore I,</p>
						<p>
							I still wonder how it will work itself out where we're fine, and the headlights will turn
							through the snow in the blinds
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>You are never very far off</p>
						<p>You are never really gone</p>
						<br />
						<p>You came through my room, yet you were withdrawn</p>
						<p>How's your hope?</p>
						<p>
							Do the lights lie unstring, cuz it just seems wrong to ever be fine, when the man you
							returned is the boy you refined?
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>And all the days that crept into your smile</p>
						<p>Withhold from you the severance of time</p>
						<p>And rid the town of every vacant sight</p>
						<p>To be alone with you one more mile</p>

						<h3>2. Orpheus</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>You were some course that offered me miles, a friend in my trials</p>
						<p>And her, what she stirred, well it hurts of worthwhile</p>
						<p>What if I stayed 'til old and im swollen in my veins,</p>
						<p>where you could trace the man I've been who wore you thin</p>
						<br />
						<p>I love you the girl of my youth</p>
						<p>Don't you wonder how</p>
						<br />
						<p>And the mornings that broke you down, you search for the boy you seldomly found</p>
						<p>If your arms could just pull him out, he wants you still</p>
						<p>Yeah, I always will</p>
						<br />
						<p>I'll miss your soul the moment it goes,</p>
						<p>but I should have known just how much I've kept from those I know best</p>
						<p>How selfish my crown</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>Out in their lores for hours, I've had my fill</p>
						<p>I took the worms for cowards, but how they kill</p>
						<p>I look forward to life as the father of kids</p>
						<p>Have you reserved my heart for this</p>
						<p>Could you show me how?</p>
						<br />
						<p>Have I told you my honest doubts, well I'm still not sure I'll ever dry out</p>
						<p>Cuz you'll be hard to do without</p>
						<p>I'll want you still,</p>
						<p>Yeah I always will</p>
						<br />
						<p>Cuz I'll miss your soul the moment it goes and slips through these folds</p>
						<p>But how long will death take to make sense, when none can be found?</p>

						<h3>3. Shiftings</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>Watch for despair has followed you out, so fast upon your heels</p>
						<p>Your staggering work to grip the earth has left you struck to every nerve</p>
						<p>And you returned for whom the strangeness lurks and is a commonness</p>
						<p>Said, “come on down, the wind blows heavy now and you are overrun”</p>
						<br />
						<p>The strength of a woman to walk this yard, when at the door you cant explain</p>
						<p>How something’s changed—the walls awake with shiftings of a wandering ghost</p>
						<p>And the billows rose in asking where you’ll go now, should it all remain?</p>
						<p>For what has begun, nothing’s won</p>
						<p>But you can learn to cope this way</p>
						<br />
						<p>And now your stretch yearns</p>
						<p>To find the breadth of relief</p>
						<p>That anyone can just leave and be gone</p>
						<p>A solemn mender</p>
						<p>The final hold of release, and when it’s gone I will need it again</p>
						<br />
						<p>I wish for dreams, the glow of lights at sea,</p>
						<p>I wish too many things</p>
						<p>But i will bring that coast what’s left of me</p>
						<p>And I will dream</p>

						<p>Darling, relent your restless arms</p>
						<p>Come along just leave his room</p>
						<p>He is strong, his mother’s strong, nothing's wrong the morning’s</p>
						<p>Soon he’ll be home, he’s on his own, he is grown, just let him loose</p>
						<p>He is strong, his mother’s strong, nothing’s wrong, he’s just like</p>
						<p>You bent to heave a clambering heart</p>
						<p>Rattled son, you have been harmed</p>
						<p>But you’re strong, your child’s strong, it is wrong but carry</p>
						<p>Through everything, your every part felt much more of hurt before any car the metals tore</p>
						<p>You were gone, you have been wronged</p>
						<br />
						<p>Careless the ropes that wore to bone</p>
						<p>Calloused my hands that never learned how to let go</p>
						<p>Careless to kill the stars, a son</p>
						<p>Calloused my will to never forgive what was done</p>
						<p>If i could start to heal for once</p>
						<p>Those labored eyes where all of my anger is lost</p>
						<p>While any fervency is mine</p>
						<p>I’ll make this right if I’m less alive when it’s done</p>

						<h3>4. No Measures</h3>
						<hr />
						<p>You look to the storm with a shuddering, back from farther days</p>
						<p>That you might have been through and yet you lose the path which you came from</p>
						<p>When the obvious part you've learned is she will never fold, for your worst has shown</p>
						<p>But you bore your mistakes with another, that you offered to always find</p>
						<p>You always tried</p>
						<br />
						<p>It comes from the north as a hollowing, the chimes that shook you first</p>
						<p>
							The times when the coffee takes so long to ever be raised to the muscles beneath your face
						</p>
						<p>
							They left you old somehow, like the kids who had pulled your sleeves and wore you down, as
							they led you unmade
						</p>
						<p>But you look farther out, to the holds of a state, and I could not get over it</p>
						<p>Have I offered an honest life?</p>
						<p>I always tried</p>
					</Col>

					<Col lg={6} md={12}>
						<p>Somehow all worth comes passing by before you rush outside</p>
						<p>To say, "Once I'd known it, even owned, yet chased for my whole life"</p>
						<p>And every ounce was you</p>
						<p>So get up</p>
						<p>Just get up! I can hear the bells stop, and bonds forgot</p>
						<p>No measures must you ever take to find me here, still under the arbor</p>
						<p>Well you're such a precious sight</p>
